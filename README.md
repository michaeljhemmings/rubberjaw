Musician/Band
Rubber Jaw are a three piece from Elmstead Market in Essex.

Rubber Jaw is comprised of lingering vocals, claustrophobic beats, weeping digital guitar effects, synthesised basses and striking visuals. With interests that span from Art Rock and Hip-Hop to 80’s wrestling promos and David Lynch, Rubber Jaw are part of the emerging sound of Essex that has been crawling its way back down the A12 into the suburbs of East London. With an ever-evolving DIY sound Rubber Jaw are hard to corner, however some have christened the movement ”Homemade Art House”.

Micheal and Ross met at primary school and have been classmates and friends ever since. In 2017 they began putting tunes together with a laptop, a single microphone and a broken hifi in the shed at the end of the garden. It was after one particularly great session the pair goaded each other into quitting their physics and art degrees respectively to pursue music. The sound was then augmented, when the duo found a video of Archie screaming and playing drums in a field; after complaints from the neighbours left him with no place to practice, and thus, Rubber Jaw was formed.
